*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci*

### dotfiles
These are the dotfiles that I use while running Arch Linux on my desktop and laptop. Originally to keep a backup that was easily accessible. I have since added tools to automate the process of installing all of the default packages I use and setting up the proper symbolic links for all of the files in this repository. If one were to use these files, it is highly recommended you fork the repository and thoroughly look over its contents to make sure all of the settings are to your liking. Many will need to be changed as they are setup with my own personal information.

### usage
```bash
Usage: ./dotme <environment> [--test]
  <environment>         environment to install (chloe, neutron, x220)
  --test                run a test instead of actually installing
```
